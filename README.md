# EntityCanonicalizationDataset

**The two publicly available source of datasets for recruitment domain entities is described below:**


1) **DBpedia** (https://wiki.dbpedia.org/) is a publically available ontology manually created based on the most commonly used infoboxes within Wikipedia.

Pairs of similar company name variations has been extracted by running query on DBpedia SPARQL endpoint (http://dbpedia-live.openlinksw.com/sparql)

-Sample query to check 100 name pairs:

select distinct ?s ?o
where {?s dbo:wikiPageRedirects ?o .
?s rdf:type dbo:Company .
?o rdf:type dbo:Company } limit 100

-All the variations of a company entity in DBpedia is, by design, mapped to 1 standard variation name. Thus, the standard variation name can be used to group all its other variations, and generate groups of unique entity clusters respectively.

The file *DBpedia_company_clusters.tsv* consists of the gold entity clusters which we used.


2) **ESCO** (https://ec.europa.eu/esco/portal/home): ESCO (European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations) is the European multilingual classification of Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations.  

We downloaded ESCO's Skills/competences referred as "ESCO-Skill" in paper, and ESCO's Occupations referred as "ESCO-Designation" in paper.

The files *esco_designation_ground_clusters.txt*  and *esco_skills_ground_clusters.txt* consists of gold clusters downloaded from website.



****Our contribution in preparing pairwise dataset for evaluating SM:****

We prepared the files *esco_designation_pairs.csv*, *esco_skills_pairs.csv*, *DBpedia_company_pairs.tsv* which consists of both similar and dissimilar pairs from open datasets using the method described in paper in Section 4.1. We plan to release this dataset which can be used to evaluate the pairwise similarity scores for variations by the research community.
